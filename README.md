1) I would not only use it to test the entire message feature because the message feature involves several components interacting with each other so a unit test would not be able to fully test the message features. A unit test would be more suitable for testing isolated logic within this feature.
2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the max message length feature of a messaging application. It is a single component that can easily be tested using a unit test. You can create tests with various input lengths to test the behavior.
